# SICP Solutions

Not necessarily just solutions, also copies of some code in the book.

Answers are mostly checked from [community.schemewiki.org](http://community.schemewiki.org/?SICP-Solutions), as well as [codology.net](https://codology.net/). 

Not necessarily the best answers, some of them are original. 

Not necessarily organized coherently, more like a companion for studying.

Lectures by Brain Harvey are on the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL3E89002AA9B9879E?sort=titleSorter).

Inspiration is from [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com/).

Let's write some good code. :coffee:
