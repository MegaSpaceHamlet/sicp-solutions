# 2.76

- Generic Operations, Explicit Dispatch
- Data-Directed Programming
- Message Passing

### 1. Which organization would be most appropriate for a system in which new _types_ must often be added? 

Data-directed/Message-Passing programming. Any time a new type need be added, one can simply install the new package, or define a new dispatcher.

### 2. Which would be most appropriate for a system in which new operations must often be added?

Generic operations with explicit dispatching. If new types being introduced into the system is an infrequent occurence, whereas new procedures is commonplace, writing a new procedure that would list each type would be easier for the developers to do. Otherwise, they would have to track down every single package/dispatcher and add the procedure there.
