## a.

Each division file should have some sort of tag, an identifier of some sort that will identify the type of file structure. A possible implementation would be to define the file structure at the top of the file so that the HQ `get-record` will know how to parse the file to look for the record. 

Alternatively, the file could provide selectors for the procedure to use to find the correct record

```
(define (get-record employee file)
  (apply-generic 'get-record employee file))
```

## b. 

Each record must be tagged with it's data type. A corresponding procedure must be installed by each division.

```
(define (get-salary record)
  apply-generic 'get-salary record))
```

## c. 

```
(define (find-employee-record employee files)
  (if (null? files) null
    (let (employee-record (get-record (car files))))
      (if (not (null? employee-record))
        employee-record
        (find-employee-record employee (cdr files))))))
```

## d. 

The only changes a new company must add are the same ones each division had to make. They must add a tag to each file and record and install the corresponding procedures.
