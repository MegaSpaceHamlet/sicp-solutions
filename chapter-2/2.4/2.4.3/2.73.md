# Exercise 2.73

## a.
By using a data-directed version of `deriv` for each of the operations, we have cut down the bloat of the code and made it easier for others to add more operations. 

Because both the `sum?` and `product?` clauses are determined by _the type of operator_, they are fitting to be data-directed. They are directed by the _symbols_, not by a predicate. Furthermore, they are both similar in that they both take the `operands` and `var` as their arguments. Therefore, they are both natural candidates for the optimization. The `number?` and `variable?` clauses do not depend on a symbol, but rather on various predicates. 

## b.

```


(define (install-sum-package)
  (define (addend exp) (car exp))
  (define (augend exp) (cadr exp))

  (define (make-sum a1 a2)
 .  ..)
  
  (define (sum operands var)
    (make-sum 
      (deriv (addend exp) var)
      (deriv (augend exp) var)))
  (put 'deriv '+ sum)
  (put 'make-sum + make-sum))

(define (make-sum a1 a2) (get 'make-sum '+) (add aug))

(define (install-product-package)
  (define (multiplier exp) (car exp))
  (define (multiplicand exp) (cadr exp))
  (define (make-product m1 m2) ...)

  (define (product operands var)
    (make-sum
      (make-product
        (multiplier exp)
        (deriv (multiplicand exp) var))
      (make-product
        (deriv (multiplier exp) var)
        (multiplicand exp))))
  
  (put 'deriv '* product)
  (put 'make-product '* make-product))

(define (make-product m1 m2) (get 'make-product) m1 m2)
```

## c.
```
(define (install-exp-package)
  
  (define (base exp) (car exp))

  (define (exponent exp) (cadr exp))

  (define (make-exponent base exponent)
    (cond ((=number? exponent 0) 0)
          ((=number? exponent 1) base)
          ((and (number? base) (number? exponent)) (expt base exponent))
          (else (list '** base exponent))))

  (define (exp operands var)
    (make-product
      (make-product 
        (exponent exp)
        (make-exponent (base exp) (- (exponent exp) 1)))
      (deriv (base exp) var)))
  (put 'deriv '** exp)
  (put 'make-exponent '** make-exponent))

(define make-exponent base exponent) (get 'make-exponent '**) base exponent))
```

## d. 

Well, for one the `put` procedures would have to be ordered differently. Additionally, the call in the `deriv` procedure would have to be re-ordered.
