## a.

`partial-tree` splits the list into 3 parts:

1. The left side of the list
2. The right side of the list
3. The middle element of the list (the _median_)

`partial-tree` continues to deconstruct the left and right sides until the entire list has been traversed.
`partial-tree` then returns a tree with the _median_ as the `entry`, plus left and right branches.

## b.

The order of growth for the `list->tree` is _O(n)_. The reason for that is because the call to `partial-tree` takes _n_ steps, and the
call to `length` takes _n_ steps. Therefore, procedure will only grow in step the the amount of elements in the list.
