## a

The 2 procesdures do return the same result for every tree.

Both procedures produce the list `(1 3 5 7 9 11)` for each tree.

## b

The first procudure has a greater order of growth than the second one becuase it makes use of the `append` function which is `O(n)`, *n* being the length of the first argument to `append`.

On the scheme wiki, people are saying that the time complexity of procedure 1 is `O(n log(n))` and the second is `O(n)`.
