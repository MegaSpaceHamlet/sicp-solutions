```
(car ''abracadabra)
(car (quote (quote abracadabra)))
```

In a nutshell, the list is (quote abracadabra) and the car of that is 'quote'.

To explain, let's look at this expression from an inside-out perspective (which
is how it's evaluated). The quotation symbol `'` is syntactic-sugar for the scheme
primitive `quote`. The `'` symbol will place the next token inside a `quote`'s
parentheses.
So after the interpreter converts `''` to `(quote (quote`, the second `quote` is read
as a symbol, not a procedure.
