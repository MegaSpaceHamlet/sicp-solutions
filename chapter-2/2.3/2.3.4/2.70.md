## Exercise 2.70

Check out `2.70.scm` to see the code that generates the tree and encodes the song. The amount of bits required is 84.

If we were to used _fixed-length_ code, the amount would be 108 bits, which is a 28+% increase from the variable-length code. The song would require 108 bits because there are 36 tokens in the song, and 8 distinct symbols. The rule mentioned earlier in the chapter dictates that 

> if we want to distinguish _n_ different symbols, we will need to use log<sub>2</sub>_n_ bit per symbol

log<sub>2</sub>8 = 3, and 3 * 36 = 108.

To put it another way, by using variable-length encoding, we are saving 22% space.
