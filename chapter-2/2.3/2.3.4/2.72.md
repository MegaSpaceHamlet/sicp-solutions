## Exercise 2.72

The answer depends on the implementation of `encode-symbol` from exercise 2.68. My version is comparitively expensive, as it checks through the symbol list of both branches at each node! (Unless it found the symbol in the left branch). On the [community scheme wiki](http://community.schemewiki.org/?sicp-ex-2.72) however, a more efficient implementation was formulated. 

The formula is as follows: only check the left branch's symbols, if found follow that path, otherwise `cons` a 1 and continue your merry way down the tree. The base case is to find the leaf, arriving at an empty list is an error! Pretty good, huh?

Now, consider the cases mentioned in exercise 2.71, where the left branch is always a leaf. That means that at every node, the time complexity is O(1). In the most frequent case, the time complexity of the operation would total O(1), and in the least frequent, it would be O(n). 

In my implementation the cost is O(n2) + O(_n - 1_)2, and so on until zero. However, in the case of our trees, it would be O(1) + O(n - our current depth). That's a whole lot more steps. For the most frequent symbol, the answer would remain the same - O(1). For the least frequent, it would come out to something uglier, maybe O(n * log<sub>n</sub>)? The truth is, I'm not so good at figuring out this stuff.
