## Exercise 2.71

Without providing sketches of the tree, I can explain that they extend ever-leftwards, and have only leaves as the right branches. The reason for this is that the sum of 2<sup>0</sup>...2<sup>_n_-1</sup> is never greater than 2<sup>_n_</sup>. It's actually a pretty cool phenomenon. One of G-d's easter eggs in numbers. 

This pattern results in trees that have left-branches with the highest occurring symbol, and right branches containing a tree with the rest, or in the case of the least-frequent symbol, a leaf. 

The most-frequent symbol will always be encoded in 1 bit, and the least frequent will require _n_ - 1 bits. Considering the pattern explained above, this is understandable, because _n_ - 2 code-trees are being created (the most-frequent and the least-frequent symbol do not create tree).
