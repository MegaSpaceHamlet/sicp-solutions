The reason it would seem that par2 is better than par1, 
and in accordance with Eva Lu Ator's note regarding the
lack of repeating uncertain numbers is as follows:

Every time that "interval arithemtic" is used, the 
bounds of the sum, or the product, or quotient, begins
to stretch wider and wider. Or, it gets smaller and 
smaller. By limiting the amount of interval arithmetic
with these "uncertain numbers", we are preventing the 
resulting bounds from exceeding proportions. 

By using the "one" interval, we are limiting that
possibility, and therefore will be able to produce
anwers with "tighter error bounds".
