# 2.84

Each type has a procedure called `level` which returns a number, symbolizing it's level in the type hierarchy. 
(This idea was taken from Brian Harvey in [lecture 18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6S-C5TAwlM&list=PLhMnuBfGeCDNgVzLPxF9o5UNKG1b-LFY9&index=17))

Then, we'll have a method called `raise-until`:

```
(define (raise-until e target-level)
  (if (eq? (level (type-tag e)) target-level)
    e
    (raise-until (raise e) target-level)))
```

In `apply-generic`: 

```
(define (apply-generic op . args)
  (let ((highest-level (max (map level (map type-tag args)))))
    (let ((coerced (map (lambda (e) (raise-until e highest-level)))))
      (let ((proc (get op (map type-tags coerced)))
        (if proc
          (apply proc (map contents args)
          (error
            "No method for these types -- APPLY-GENERIC"
            (list op type-tags)))))))))
```
