The reason Alyssa's answer works is because when calling `(magnitude z)` on a complex number, the function `magnitude` is then called on the contents of the complex number. The contents of the complex number are `('rectangular 3 4)`, and `magnitude` itself calls `apply-generic` on that list. There is a `magnitude` implemented on the rectangular type, and that is what is called. 

In all, `apply-generic` is called twice, first on `('complex 'rectangular 3 4)`, which invokes `apply-generic` on the complex type, which in turn invokes `real-type` on the contents, which is a rectangular type. Then, `apply-generic` is called on`('rectangular 3 4)`, and the actual `real-part` that was implemented for the rectangular type is invoked.
