# 2.88

We would first make sure that a generic negation operation is available for all the types in our arithmetic system. 

Then, in the polynomial package, we will define `sub-poly`. The rule for subtracting polynomials is to subtract the coefficients of terms of the same order.  
So, for example, the polynomial [2x<sup>2</sup> + 5x + 1] - [x<sup>2</sup> + 3 + 1] = [x<sup>2</sup> + 2x]

In our code: 

```
(define (sub-poly p1 p2)
  (if (same-variable? (variable p1) (variable p2))
    (make-poly (variable p1)
      (sub-terms (term-list p1) (term-list p2)))
    (error "Polys not in same var: SUB-POLY" (list p1 p2))))

(define (sub-terms L1 L2)
  (cond ((empty-termlist? L2) L1)
        ((empty-termlist? L1) (negate L2))
        (else
          (let ((t1 (first-term L1))
                (t2 (first-term L2)))
            (cond ((> (order t1) (order t2)
                    (adjoin-term
                      t1
                      (sub-terms (rest-terms L1) L2))))
                  ((< (order t1) (order t2))
                    (adjoin-term
                      t2
                      (sub-terms L1 (rest-terms L2))))
                  (else
                    (adjoin-term
                      (make-term
                        (order t1)
                        (negate (coeff t1) (coeff t2))))))))))
```
