```
(define (adjoin-term term term-list)
  (let ((order (order term)
        (tl-length (length (term-list)))))
      (if (> order tl-length)
        (if (> 1 (- order tl-length))
          (cons (coeff term) (cons (enumarate-zeroes (- order     tl-length) term-list)))
          (cons (coeff term) term-list))
        (cons (slice term-list 0 (- order 1) (coeff term) (slice term-list (+ order 1) (length term-list)))))))
        
```

Where `slice` is defined as `(slice l start end)` and returns a slice of the list from start until end, exclusive.

```
(define (the-empty-termlist) '())

(define (first-term term-list)
  (if (eq? (car term-list) 0)
    (first-term (rest-terms term-list)
    (car term-list))))

(define (rest-terms term-list) (cdr term-list))

(define (empty-termlist? term-list) (null? term-list))
```

Term constructors & selectors are the same.
