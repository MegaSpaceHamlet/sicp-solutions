# 3.36

Not everything was included for brevity's sake.

Also, this won't be legible on a narrow screen, becuase I used basic ASCII characters to draw the environment.

`for-each-except` is run inside the environment that `make-connect` created for the variable `a`,
which in turn is bound in the global environment.
