# 3.32

If the system were not to process the operations in a FIFO (first-in, first-out) order, the entire system would be unreliable. Everything in the system is interdependent. If two operations were registered for the same time-slot and op 2 occurred before op 1, op 2 would be false because it would not reflect the true value of (the outcome of) op 1. Similarly, op 1 would be operating under false assumptions in that op 2 had already altered the wire signals.
