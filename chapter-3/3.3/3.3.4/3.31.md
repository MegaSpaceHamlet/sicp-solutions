# 3.31 - Why Call `proc` in `add-action-procedure!`?

Imagine plugging a live wire into a machine. The electricity courses throught the wire into the receptacle immediately. 
In this program we are representing live wires in a digital circuit. An `add-action-procedure!` call is akin to plugging a wire
in to a receptacle. The change takes place immediately. 

Without the initialization, the values of the wires do not update correctly. 

For example, in the `half-adder` example, even before calling propogate, there is an `inverter` gate in the adder from the carry wire
to the _e_ wire. _e_ in turn affects the sum wire. The thing is, because `inverter` was not called immediately, _e_ remains 0, but it's supposed to be 1.

I'll admit, it's a bit hard to wrap the head around, and I've probably already spent too much time trying to pinpoint it. I understood it intuitively, but am having trouble precisely defining to point where things go wrong.
