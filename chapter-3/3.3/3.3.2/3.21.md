# 3.21

Ben's mistake is that the queue is made up of two pointers, one at the head of the queue, and one at the tail. Therefore, when printing the queue, the last element of the queue will be printed twice, once from the list that the head is pointing to, and once from the tail.

In order to properly print a queue, the procedure must only print the list that the head is pointing to. That way, the tail will not be referenced twice.

```scheme
(define (print-queue queue) (front-ptr queue))
```
