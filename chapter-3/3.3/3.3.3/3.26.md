# 3.26 - Tables with Sets Represented as Binary Trees

The `lookup` and `insert!` procedures would have to be modified in how they read and write to the table.
The basic algorithm of checking whether or not a record exists, and acting upon that in the `insert!` function
would remain the same.

When inserting a record, we could use the same algorithm used in chapter 2 when describing binary trees.
When looking up a record, utilizing `assoc` would be insufficient. `assoc` does not expect a binary tree data structure.
We would have to define a new `assoc` function that would traverse the tree and return the result if found, and false if not.
The leaf of the tree would be the simple `cons`ed pair, as in our current representation.

As a side note, using binary trees will be much more efficient now that we have `set-car!` and `set-cdr!`.
