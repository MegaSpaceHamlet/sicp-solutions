# 3.27 - Memoization

At the core of what the book is saying, is that in the event that `memoize` is given a number `n` that it
did not compute, it would still have a major advantage. When calling `memo-fib` of `n - 1` and `n - 2`, the table
is still being checked for those numbers. That means that defining `memo-fib` as `(memoize fib)` would not help. 
Because if `memo-fib` of `n` had nothing in the table, it would call _regular_ `fib` of `n - 1` and `n - 2`, which 
would no longer reference the table, and therefore be an operation with an exponential order of growth. In the correctly
defined `memo-fib`, however, the procedure keeps on checking the table for computed results at each successive breakdown.

E.g.

```scheme

(memo-fib 100)

; breaks down to 

(+ (memo-fib 99) (memo-fib 98))

; Here's the kuntz: if memo-fib 88 and 98 were previously computed, it's going to be an O(1) operation

; Later, we call

(memo-fib 100) 

; That was fast
