# 3.40

1,000,000: x = x<sup>2</sup> = 100, 100<sup>3</sup> = 1,000,000, or the other way around
10,000: p1 get x = 10, then p2 sets x to 1000, 10 * 1000 = 10,000. Or, p2 gets x, computes x * x = 100, p1 sets x to 100, p2 does 100 * 100
100: p1 computes x<sup>2</sup>, then p2 sets x to 10<sup>3</sup> = 1,000, then p1 sets x to 100
100,000: p2 gets x = 10, then p1 sets x to 100, the p2 sets 10 * 100 * 100
1,000: pt computes 10<sup>3</sup> = 1,000, then p1 sets x to 100, the p2 sets x to 1000

After serializing, only, 1,000,000 exists.
