Serializing the `balance` accessor will not help improve the program. The reason is because, even if this operation is serialized, there may still be calls to `withdraw` or `deposit` that are going to be executed later. Within each of those the functions, there is a `begin` statement that retrieves the balance, and if at that moment `balance` is gotten elsewhere, the end balance will still be `balance - amount` or `balance + amount` according to `balance` as it was retrieved in the beginning of the `begin` statement. The `balance` is guaranteed not to be altered during the actual execution of `withdraw`/`deposit`, because those operations are serialized. Thus, even though we cannot guarantee the exact order of the operations, we know that they will be executed in some order. And serializing the `balance` accessor will not change anything.
